# Prerequisites

The intended audience for this book is anyone make using of *Real Econometrics: The Right Tools to Answer Important Questions* 2nd ed. by Michael Bailey who would like to learn the R code necessary to complete the end of chapter exercises.  We really heavily on the `tidyverse` a collection of packages that shares an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.  We also make use of a variety of packages (bundles of code) where it will make coding more straightfoward in terms of writing, understanding, and editing.   


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
